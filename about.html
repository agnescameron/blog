	This is a web diary of agnes cameron. It's named after the art duo fischlli and weiss' piece <i><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/82033">things from the room in the back</a></i>, a precise polyureathane recreation of small pieces of junk they found at the back of their studio. this is largely a technical blog: if you came for snacks, you might be better off at <a href="https://backseatfrying.net/">backseat frying dot net</a>.</p>

<p>
	This site was made using Dave Liepman's <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a> theme, a css interpretation of tufte-book, and Jekyll, a static site generator. send complaints, questions, frog pics etc to <u>agnesfcameron[at]gmail.com</u>

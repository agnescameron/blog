During my [research fellowship](/2025/01/10/satellite.html) with Bellingcat, I spent a lot of time researching interesting remote sensing tools, indices and datasets, far too many to document in my eventual writeup.

I saved a lot of these tools (plus papers and links) on are.na, but thought it would be nice to share my notes on what I found most interesting and helpful.

## tool-dataset map

One of the initial directions for the project was to characterise the landscape of satellite imaging datasets and tools more broadly, including an analysis of which tool inherits from which dataset (a kind of who's using X for Y map). I still think this is an interesting exercise -- some of these relationships seem to be by convention, others by practicality.

## index based tools


## machine learning tools


## interesting datasets


## fun techniques


## SAR and Polarimetry

After the Bellingcat piece was published, I was contacted by a citizen science organisation who work on water issues between France, Belgium and the DRC. Recently I was asked if I could help with some imaging questions after the Rennes floods, specifically getting satellite images that weren't affected by cloud cover.

Spatial Aperture Radar data is distinct from regular 

I'm still working on this -- in order to get some more useful information e.g. about water turbidity and pollution (rather than just the extent of the floods) I think [some stats](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/detecting-changes-in-sentinel-1-imagery-pt-1) will be required.

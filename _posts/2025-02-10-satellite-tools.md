During my [research fellowship](/2025/01/10/satellite.html) with Bellingcat, I spent a lot of time researching interesting remote sensing tools, indices and datasets. I was also quite interested in the question of what tool inherits from which dataset, some of which seems to be by convention, others by practicality.

I saved a lot of these (plus papers and links) on are.na, but thought it would be nice to share my notes on what I found most interesting and helpful.

## index based tools


## machine learning tools


## interesting datasets


## fun techniques

For over a year now, gary and I have maintained a recipe website called 'backseat frying'. It was originally a birthday present for our friend [adam](http://www.adamjhh.com) (and, indeed it still is) though it's since proliferated a few more tendrils. It even has its own [blog](https://backseatfrying.net/blog/blog.html) nestled (though no RSS... can it really be considered a blog...).

For a long time I never cooked with recipes: I loved to read cookbooks, but when I wanted to cook I would close them, and do my own thing. Backseat frying was indeed, originally requested to encode some of the things that gary and I coooked in text. Of late, however -- perhaps from a newfound appreciation for the recipes, or perhaps craving tastes I have no idea how to make -- I've found myself cooking from recipes on a regular basis.

Recipe websites have also proliferated since the start of lockdown: Nika Fisher even has an are.na channel dedicated to them  ... I think what's nice is that it really feels like the world can hold all of them at once: all recipe websites are different, all are special, all have their own great features. Are.na channel about recipe forms -- how you think about a recipe changes your relationship to it, and recipe websites are what shapes these relationships.


Collected an [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/recipe-exercise) of different approaches to writing a recipe.

### recipe as meme

We're also in a bit of a weird moment for recipe blogs. The proliferation of bon appetit and the 'food-as-meme' social media trend has done something weird. This spring I've been reading a lot of food blog and almost without fail each one that's being regularly updated at the moment includes some recipe for Dalgona Coffee. It's a whipped, simple, attractive-looking meme food. It probably tastes nice. It's maybe got something to do with search engine optimisation, or maybe just the participation in a Zeitgeist. (I guess who am I to spurn Dalgona Coffee. perhaps backseat frying should do one.)

food blogs are marketised and monetised which -- isn't a bad thing necessarily, but also changes the dynamics. You also get some weird bits

logic of the market in recipe blogs

'dalgona coffee'

but then like... let people have their meme


decontextualised, race dimension, much better written about here: https://www.eater.com/2020/5/20/21262304/global-pantry-alison-roman-bon-appetit

"Do you know interesting things I found while reading? I was curious about meal replacement shakes and I wanted to read more details on how any person can replace their meal with just a shake! That sounds really interesting, right?" (alas)

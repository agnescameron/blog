[*The First 10,000 Years*](https://fud.global/) is a collaboration with [Gary](http://zhexi.info/), part of his larger body of work on the catastrophe insurance industry. The whole project is called [*FUD*](https://www.artscatalyst.org/fud), named for both the bitcoin-speculator acronym 'Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt', and for its sonic qualities. *The First 10,000 years* simulates a market-simulation -- a 10,000 year model -- that serves as the backbone of a speculative trading platform and forum.

It's still a work in progress, and I'm currently circling back to a second version and wanted to wtite down my thoughts. We ended up making the first iteration over the course of about a week, and it's more of a sketch of what's possible than a full simulation in it's own right. As such, this post is about these small, basic component models that with a bit of love will flourish into real, functional objects.


### the first 10,000 years

The catastrophe insurance industry relies on

 10,000 year models are used throughout the catastrophe

Of late, this form of simualtion is being forced to radically shift: climate change 

### risk model

HURDAT dataset

slightly different as this is everything that *turned into* a hurricane.

next steps using [turf](https://pypi.org/project/pyturf/) or [geopandas]() to do polygons

also maybe do some ML on actual losses associated with these hurricanes, much closer to how these hedge funds are doing it

### dialog models

These are dumb right now but they could be much smarter. Currently, the dialog operates in 3 kind of 'wheels', or degrees of immediacy and involvement

One suggestion Dan had was to have the chat itself be the trading interface, with agents making trades -- a bit like the image of the Starship Bistromath in the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, where the ship navigates on the basis of complex interactions between diners and waiters in a bistro.

Setting up a tiny IRC was immediately really exciting. At the very start, it was just a http endpoint, and my friend Dan and I spent half an hour just chatting using cURL. Even now, when I see a stranger in the chat screen it's strangely thrilling. Perhaps it's just nostalgia but there's a kind of danger to it... you could say anything or be anyone... I guess this is why people like 4chan.

## market

We started off modelling the market in a Google sheet, working out 

spreadsheet



market not really a market -- agents make bids based on their own internal state and then the market evens it out in terms of buys and sells. this is a proxy: really the agents look at the other bids that are being made and exercise their

How do we define the language used to talk about food? From supermarket SKUs, to recipes, to trade agreements, to tasting notes on cheese, to chemical formulas for medicines, the language of food is required to range from the highly subjective and contextual to the precisely scientific.

Ontologies are manifestos for how the world *should* be organised -- they are large small, formal and informal. When we think about ontologies at all they can feel a lot like universal constants: things that happen to us, or happen to be a certain way, or are self-evident, rather than things that are made. To an extent, this is true -- 

formalisation of tacit knowledge 

For example, the hierarchy of Chinese cooking techniques (what methods there are, which are subsets of other methods)  

There is an impulse within ontology design toward a utopian completeness: if only *everything* could be described precisely enough, then we might be able to talk using the same language. This is the goal of projects like Abstract Wikipedia, described in Denny Vrandecic's paper [Architecture for a Multilingual Wikipedia](https://research.google/pubs/pub49051/), which outlines a scheme for using the WikiLambda indrastructure to abstract Wikipedia content from its native language, using a meta-Wikipedia composed of collaboratively-written functions. As he states:

> *Abstract Wikipedia aims to create and maintain the content of Wikipedia for all languages only once, and then render it in the natural language of the reader*

While on many levels this is a laudable project that -- particularly for updates to things like dates 

In this sense, language stands in for something there's otherwise not a lot of space for on Wikipedia: the co-existence of multiple 'truths' about a particular topic.

Mark Graham's 2012 article [The Problem With Wikidata](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-problem-with-wikidata/255564/) "In particular, the ability of each language edition to exist independently has allowed each language community to contextualize knowledge for its audience."

### Naming

The ARK project presents a different approach to naming, and one that I 

Anyone can set up a naming scheme that ends up with unique identifiers. More than that, the things you name can change  persistent identifiers

Projects of complete naming can be useful but also functions of concentrations of power if they are made in a top-down way. For example, 

Omar Rizwan's essay [*Against Recognition*](https://omar.website/posts/against-recognition/) gets at this very eloquently. In it, he articulates a desire to use computer systems for *storage and orchestration*, as distinct from digesting, reconciling and indexing it. 

> *"a lot of things in the computer are not really about computation; they are artifacts made by people for people. it should be normal to put things inside the computer that the computer itself cannot digest, but that it can pass on to your future self or to other people."*

It's inspiring, and it makes me think about what the equivalent is for ontology design, especially in the context of food. One idea I had a while ago was to think about modes of recipe writing in terms of their informational resolution: from a terse sentence-level 

Language and the construction of recipes

What's true is that what you index ends up being what the system cares about. I think that's something that's worth asking of many ontology systems 


There's something very 

sometimes you have to give things a name
the name isn't always right
much better to accept that will happen and have a system that can change than imagine you can do without



Naming a few systems where food ontologies play a role + thinking about what's involved
* recipe adjustments and substitutions
	* corollary: searching for recipes online/recipe indexing/entity reconciliation
* trade agreements and agricultural language (FoodON, AgroVOC)
* chemical/flavour definition, tasting panels, measurement

### FoodON

"FoodOn, launched in 2018, is a recently developed ontology that aims to describe food known in cultures throughout the world for human, domestic and agricultural animal consumption."

trade ontologies interaction with logistics and globalisation. the drive to *make* a universal food ontology in the first place / collapsing local context. 

AGRO, FoodON, "Basic formal ontology" or BFO




### Adjusting Recipes

machine-learning projects that reverse-engineer recipe from photo... I personally struggle with this one as it relies on .. but then perhaps it's not so far off (my method of choosing a restaurant typically involves intense browsing of the pictures on google maps followed by cross-referencing to the menu...)

One thing that feels certain about ontologies is that the more time you spend making them, the more time you will spend making them.

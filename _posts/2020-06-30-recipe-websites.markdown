For nearly a year now, gary and I have maintained a recipe website called 'backseat frying'. It was originally a birthday present for our friend 

For a long time I never cooked with recipes: I loved to read cookbooks, but when I wanted to cook I would close them, and do my own thing. Of late, however -- perhaps from a newfound appreciation for the recipes, or perhaps craving tastes I have no idea how to make -- I've found myself cooking from recipes on a regular basis.

Recipe websites have also proliferated since lockdown: Nika Fisher even has an are.na channel dedicated to them  ... I think what's nice is that it really feels like the world can hold all of them at once: all recipe websites are different, all are special, all have their own great features.

Collected an [are.na channel](https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/recipe-exercise) of different approaches to writing a recipe.

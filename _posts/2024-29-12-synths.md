This year I've been involved in making two different synthesisers. The first of these has been a collaboration with the electronic musician John Richards, aka the [Dirty Electronics Ensemble](https://www.dirtyelectronics.org/) with artwork by Colin Therlemont ([Tellamont](https://bandcamp.com/tellamont)). The name of the project is _More Roar_, and the synth is a digital frequency modulation synthesiser built using a STM32 microcontroller.

The second was made by me for a new performance by the _Commission for New and Old Art_ (heareafter: the _Commission_). The whole performance was called Valves; the synth was for a new piece called _On Pendle Hill_, composed by Oliver Vibrans. The specific requirement for this synthesiser was that it be made using a vacuum tube -- a _thermionic valve_ -- and the eventual design was based on a design by [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/) called the [_Safety Valve_](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/the-safety-valve).

In both cases, I've been thinking a lot about the political nature of different technologies, technology's militariness and the resistance to co-optation of artistic work made using technical things. These concerns feel particularly urgent in the context of the genocide in Gaza, and the occupation of the West Bank. Military technologies are not just the drones ([manufactured in the UK](https://caat.org.uk/data/countries/israel/israels-arms-industry-its-links-with-the-uk/)), the guns and bombs used to kill Palestinians, or even the Israeli surveillance infrastructure built by [Google and Amazon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/23/what-is-project-nimbus-and-why-are-google-workers-protesting-israel-deal), but the systems of capital and convenience that sustain this status quo.

My original training is in electronic engineering, and I still subscribe to the IET's jobs mailing list -- these days it's almost entirely dominated by weapons companies. Moving back toward electronics (after years of mostly making work with the web) I find myself wanting to understand and use technologies where the overlap (in expertise, documentation, components) feels much closer to this militarised domain of engineering. 

<!-- There's a sense sometimes that the answer to this is either the simple invocation of a kind of 'creativity' or 'good intention' -- a use of technical things for purely artistic and benevolent means -- or refusal to engage in the first place. I disagree with the former (after all, the [art school](https://www.instagram.com/ual_sjp/) where I work is also complicit in genocide), and I think the latter is a contextual decision. ?? -->

## Valves

Some of the initial ideas for the valve synthesiser came from a conversation with Sam Fairbrother of the _Commission_ a couple of years ago, where, during a conversation about AI he asked me *"Can you make a peaceful machine?"* -- eg, is it possible to think about a pacifist technology. I found the question very difficult to answer, and still do.

_Valves_ as a performance circulated around the valve within brass instruments and vacuum tubes, as a unifying theme through post industrial areas of Northern England. It included a reading from *King John*, the Hebden Bridge Brass Band playing the Beatles, and a new piece of music.

*On Pendle Hill* is a piece composed for baritone horn, brass chorus, valve synthesiser and clogs. The horn and brass chorus were performed by Troy Kelly and the Hebden Bridge Brass Band, with Lydia Philips and I playing the synth and Sam Fairbrother clogging. The piece also included an audio recording of Ellie Kinney, a peace activist, from the top of Pendle Hill, narrating her view of a landscape that contains multiple weapons factories, and her view of the Northwestern UK as a specifically militarised industrial zone.

A lot of the ideas about the synthesiser (and the sound texture we made with it!), developed in conversation with Lydia Philips and [Kat MacDonald](https://otherkat.com/). A lot of the discussion centered around making sense of this military-industry-hardware-sound relationship. There's a lot there -- Raytheon, the world's largest defence contractor, was initially a vacuum tube manufacturing company. The 12AX7, the vacuum tube is a close relative of the 12AU7 -- the military equivalent of which (5814A) was apparently developed for their Sidewinder missile in early 1950s. Meanwhile, the 'great Northern industry' that the brass band has historically symbolised increasingly includes [weapons manufacturing](https://caat.org.uk/data/companies/).

At the end of the program notes for _Valves_, we included a line "we'd like to think there's another way". In technical teaching, I think there's something important in showing that there are many ways to do things -- it helps to understand technical things as something not monolithic tools, but rather (to paraphrase a [nice essay](https://pages.sandpoints.org/sandpoints/ubu5050ubus-8daa49c3/reflection/autonomous-archive/) by Cristóbal Sciutto), a medium that one can have a degree of agency over.

## More Roar

_More Roar_ was developed specifically in an artistic/educational context. In March this year, I invited John to come to the [CCI](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) to run a synth-building workshop for our students. I'd remembered going to one of John's workshops as an electronic engineering undergraduate, and experiencing electronics as this totally different, vibrant thing. I loved (and still do love) the maths and theory of electronics, but there was a liveness to the synth that we made that felt very different, and quite transformative.

John decided to use this as an opportunity to develop code for a chip he'd not worked with before, and after some discussion he settled on the [STM32 microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM32), which had recently been made available as a tiny 8-pin package. After the workshop, he asked if I'd be interested in developing it further into a project together. Much of my contribution to the project has been to write the code for the [FM synthesis](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1dLrLAFyj1qOBhgkgtjH0oDM67nwY9DkMXg1a5tIjvx4/mobilebasic?pli=1) algorithm, and later the decay function that periodically adds noise to the signal. This was a very enjoyable process of writing some ultimately quite simple code. It's humbling to come back to microcontrollers after about a decade away and realise just how theoretical and ungrounded your engineering education was.

Currently in my department, the electronics education most of our students recieve involves learning Arduino, perhaps experimenting with other boards (like the ESP32) or the Raspberry Pi. There's something very exciting about handing a student a bare chip, show them how to program it using just a text editor. There's something very liberating abotu that process.

Microcontrollers are funny things, as they bring you much more directly into contact with control over a medium (movement of electrons around a piece of silicon) and in the process highlight just how far removed from the medium you yourself are. A lot of John's work that I really appreciate is taking these chips that cost about £2 and maximising the kind of sounds they can make. One thing lots of people say to me is, how does something that small make such a big sound?

We are still tweaking the code, but plan to release the synth early next year.
